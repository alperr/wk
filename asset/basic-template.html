	<h2>hello</h2>
	<p>this page is generated by a command line interface: <strong>wk</strong> </p>
	<p>web apps generated with <strong>wk</strong> are composed of <strong>components</strong></p>
	<h3>what is a component?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>every independently functioning part of a user interface is called as <strong>component</strong></li>
		<li>every component contains one <strong>javascript</strong>, <strong>css</strong> and <strong>html</strong> file</li>
		<li><strong>components</strong> are stored under <strong>src/components/</strong> as individual folders</li>
		<li>every project contains a main component named <strong>app</strong></li>
		<li class="accent">you can tweak this app component's style by editing <strong>src/components/app/app.css</strong> file</li>
		<li>markup of web-app component is written into <strong>src/components/app/app.html</strong></li>
		<li>components are defined as <strong>functions</strong> in .js files and any component can create another one just by calling the constructor of that component</li>
		<li>program entry point is <strong>src/components/web-app/web-app.js</strong></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		all other .js files should be placed under <strong>src/</strong> folder.
		wk concatanates every .js files in src folder (including javascript files of each component)
		and serves them as a single javascript file, hence you don't have to use 
		<span class="accent">require()</span> or <span class="accent">import</span>
		to develop in a	multiple file javascript environment, everything you write is registered to global.
